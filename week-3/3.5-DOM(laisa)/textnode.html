<!--   output:

Element Node: <div>
Text Node: "This is a div element."
Element Node: <p>
Text Node: "This is a paragraph."
Element Node: <p>
Text Node: "Another paragraph with"
Element Node: <b>
Text Node: "bold text"
Text Node: "."


theory:


In JavaScript, querySelectorAll or querySelector cannot be used to
find text nodes because they are designed to work only with element nodes that
match a CSS selector. Text nodes are not selectable via CSS selectors, so you cannot directly 
use querySelector to find them.


However, if you specifically want to find text nodes, you need to use methods like 
childNodes, which includes all types of nodes (element nodes, text nodes, and others).

To Summarize:

querySelector / querySelectorAll: Works with element nodes (like div, p, etc.) but does not return text nodes.

childNodes: Includes text nodes along with element nodes, so you can access text nodes with it.
