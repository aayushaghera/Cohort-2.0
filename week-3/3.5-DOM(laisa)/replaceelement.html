        <ul id="myList">
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Tea</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Click "replace" to replace the second item in the list</p>

        <button onclick="myFunction()">Replace</button>

        <p>This example replaces the text node "Tea" with a text node "Juice". Replacing the entire `li` element is also an alternative.</p>

        <script>
            function myFunction() {
                const element = document.getElementById("myList").children[2];

                const newnode = document.createTextNode("Juice");

                element.replaceChild(newnode, element.childNodes[0]);
            }
        </script>

Key Differences:

Node Types Included:

children includes only element nodes.

Returned Object:

childNodes returns a NodeList, which is a collection of nodes.
children returns an HTMLCollection, which is a collection of elements.

Common Use Cases:

Use childNodes when you need to access or manipulate both elements and text within an element.
Use children when you only want to work with element nodes and ignore text nodes or comments.
