// The Pick utility type in TypeScript is a handy tool that lets you create a new type by choosing only specific properties 
// from an existing one. This is especially useful when you’re working with a large or complex object type, but only need to use 
// a few of its properties. Instead of writing a new type from scratch, Pick allows you to reuse parts of an existing type, making
//  your code cleaner and more maintainable. For example, if you have a User type that contains information like id, name, email,
//  and createdAt, but you only need name and email for a user profile display, you can use Pick to create a new type with just 
// those two properties. This helps improve type safety because TypeScript will make sure you're only using the allowed properties, 
// and it also makes your code easier to understand and reduces repetition. In short, Pick helps you focus on exactly the data you need,
//  while still keeping everything organized and error-free.
// ✅ Original Concept:
// "The Pick utility type in TypeScript is a powerful feature that allows you to construct new types by selecting a subset of properties from an existing type."
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// "Pick is a handy tool that lets you create a new type by choosing only specific properties from an existing one."
// ✅ Original Concept:
// "This can be particularly useful when you need to work with only certain fields of a complex type..."
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// "...especially useful when you’re working with a large or complex object type, but only need to use a few of its properties."
// ✅ Original Concept:
// "The syntax for Pick is: Pick<Type, Keys>"
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// I didn’t restate the syntax directly (to keep it simple), but I explained the concept using a real example.
// ✅ Original Concept (Example with User, UserProfile, displayUserProfile)
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// I explained the exact same example:
// "...if you have a User type... but only need name and email... you can use Pick to create a new type with just those two properties."
// ✅ Original Concept:
// Benefits of Pick:
// Enhanced Type Safety
// Code Readability
// Reduced Redundancy
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// ✔️ Type safety: "...TypeScript will make sure you're only using the allowed properties..."
// ✔️ Readability: "...makes your code easier to understand..."
// ✔️ DRY/Reduced redundancy: "...reduces repetition."
// ✅ Conclusion (Your Quote):
// "It allows you to be explicit about what properties a function or component expects..."
// 🟢 In Simple Version:
// "...helps you focus on exactly the data you need, while still keeping everything organized and error-free."
